TODO:
  - loading elements animation when refresh button is hit on /browse-rooms
  - chat.io large logo on all menu type pages
  - chat.io small logo in corner of all other screens (needs to be on every screen)
  - make chat.io logo a link to homepage
  - create room page form values actually sent to server (private & profanity options)
  - better hover effect for buttons
  - text labels for buttons when hovered over
  - name character validation 

MAYBE TODO:
  - different wavy background image
  - admin(or maybe main menu) type dashboard where you can see a graph of (time, playersOnline), peak players today, total players




NEWEST:
  

  - add way to kick players as the host. Might want a 'manage room' button that can be clicked to bring up a menu that lists all players
    along with an option to promote them to host or kick them from the lobby
    need more code to prevent a kicked player from joining the same lobby again.
    (need extra list for kicked players stored in server that is checked.) Also need to store and load user id localStorage 
    so a kicked user is still uniquely identifiable as the same person after being kicked. YES the user will be able to modify 
    their user id manually in local storage, but the common person would not think to do that. As this app doesnt have user accounts stored in a db, 
    the browser is the best way to 'remember' user data via localstorage

  - add chat message for kicked players.

  - profanity filter on messages

  - add chat GPT prompter with Q and A displayed in chat.


DONE:
  - add a typing animation when another user is typing.

  - if user is not scrolled to the bottom, notify them when a new message is received.
    May have to rework code to use 'onScroll' event since the 'new messages' button should also 
    be able to disappear by simply scrolling to the bottom and not clicking the 'new messages' button.
  
  - fix problem where user leaves room while typing a message and will be left as still 'typing' in that lobby.

  - add chat message for new players and players leaving.

  - unique icon for room host in players list
